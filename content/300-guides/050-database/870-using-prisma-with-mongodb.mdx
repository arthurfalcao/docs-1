This guide discusses the concepts behind using Prisma and MongoDB, explains the commonalities and differences between MongoDB and other database providers, and leads you through the process for configuring your application to integrate with MongoDB.

## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like document format.

Features include:

- **Flexible schemas** ...
- **Support for scaling** ...
- ...

## Commonalities with other database providers

Some aspects of using Prisma with MongoDB are the same as when using Prisma with a relational database. You can still:

- model your database with the [Prisma Schema Language](/concepts/components/prisma-schema)
- connect to your database, using the [`mongodb` database connector](/concepts/database-connectors/mongodb)
- use [Introspection](/concepts/components/introspection) for existing projects if you already have a MongoDB database
- use [`db push`](/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push) to push changes in your schema to the database
- use [Prisma Client](/concepts/components/prisma-client) in your application to query your database

## Differences to consider

MongoDB's document-based structure and flexible schemas means that using Prisma with MongoDB differs from using it with a relational database in a number of ways. These are some areas where there are differences you need to be aware of:

**Migrating old data to new schemas.** In relational databases, all your data must match your schema. If you change the type of a particular field in your schema when you migrate, all the data must also be updated to match. In contrast, MongoDB does not enforce
For more information, see [How to migrate old data to new schemas](#how-to-migrate-old-data-to-new-schemas).

**Introspection.** When you introspect an existing database, you will get a schema with no relations and will need to add the missing relations in manually. For more information, see [How to add in missing relations after Introspection](#how-to-add-in-missing-relations-after-introspection).

**Using `undefined` vs `null`.**

**Replica sets.**

## How to migrate old data to new schemas

Types:

- On-demand: when you add a new field to your schema, the past data isn't touched. But when you go and read the collection, the collection is adjusted, so when you write the data back, your data now matches your schema.
- No breaking change policy: Don't rename or delete fields, only add fields.
- All-at-once: where you update your schema and your past data to match your new schema all at once. This is a requirement for relational databases.

## More on using MongoDB with Prisma

The fastest way to start using MongoDB with Prisma is to refer to our Getting Started documentation:

- [Start from scratch](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/mongodb-typescript-mongodb)
- [Add to existing project](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/add-to-existing-project/mongodb-typescript-mongodb)

These tutorials will take you through the process of connecting to MongoDB, pushing schema changes, and using the Prisma Client.
